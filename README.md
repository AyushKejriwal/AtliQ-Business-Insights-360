## Company Background

AtliQ Hardware is one of the fastest-growing electronics companies, manufacturing and selling PCs, mice, printers, and other electronic goods globally. Products reach consumers through three channels:

- **Retailers**: Brick & mortar stores (Chroma, Best Buy) and e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Flipkart)
- **Direct**: AtliQ's own exclusive stores
- **Distributors**: Regional distribution partners handling logistics in regulated markets like China and South Korea

After suffering significant losses from a failed Latin America expansion driven by decisions based on surveys and gut instinct rather than data AtliQ's leadership made data analytics adoption their top strategic priority. This project was born from that initiative.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware was relying on Excel-based reporting and regional manager phone calls to make critical business decisions. This led to:

- Biased "rosy picture" reporting from regional teams
- Inability to quickly identify underperforming markets and products
- No standardized, company-wide view of business health
- Costly strategic missteps (Latin America expansion)

Meanwhile, competitors like Dell were leveraging sophisticated analytics teams to gain market advantage.
